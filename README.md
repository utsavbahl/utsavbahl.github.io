## About Me
I was born and raised in Geneva, Switzerland to parents who work as UN Civil Servants. I have a brother and a labrador retriver who also live in Geneva. Apart from my academic interests and life as a student at Williams, I like to read and write. In particular, I enjoy writing fiction and creative non-fiction. I also write for [The Williams Record](https://williamsrecord.com/staff_name/utsav-bahl/) as an opinions columnist. I play football (soccer) as a non-competitive hobby at Williams. In the past, I have played competitively at the youth level in Geneva for [FC Collex-Bossy](https://www.fccollexbossy.ch/). I currently work as a teaching assistant at Williams College too for POEC 253: [Empirical Methods in Political Economy](https://catalog.williams.edu/poec/detail/?strm=&cn=253&crsid=010859&req_year=0). In the past, I have worked as a teaching assistant in Statistics as well as a research assistant in Economics, Political Science, and Psychology. I am fluent in English and French and conversational in Hindi.
